I  grew up lusting for a certain status. They call her the manic pixie girl. She’s the cool, unobtainable chick everyone fawns over. I cut bangs like Zooey Deschanel, I spent ridiculous amounts on ‘vintage’ goods and re- ligiously listened to Regina Sparks. I become obsessed with becoming an obsession. The reality I was a gawky 14 year old wearing a polka dot dress when boys my age were exclusively courting the girls with B cups and pan- da eyes. But alas I continued my journey towards an un- achievable persona. It’s been years since I thought
about being ‘that’ girl, and pinned it on not
being adorable enough and accepted that. Only recently had the term emerged again and I realized I never achieved the title not because I didn’t wear enough lace or my eyes weren’t bug-like enough.
I have always had a personality and opinion, and never compromised that, and that my friends are the underlining reasons I never would be able to gain that prestige. Of course my painfully awkward existence was part of it, but I was never willing to be but a product of the male gaze.
The Manic Pixie Dream Girl was penned first by film critic Nathan Rabin after his viewing of Eliza- bethtown and realization of the trend of personality void female supporting characters. He describes the MPDG as “that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life.” As characters, they never advance; they are simply there to enrich the male leads life. They are put on pedestals of unobtainable heights,
and encouraged not to do anything that shows real emotion but face criticism when not ‘opening up’ to their counterpart. The best part of
it all is if all expectation isn’t met, we pity the poor de- sponding lead as he reluctantly discards the relations.
Sadly my favorite literary and film characters are all
held to unreasonable prospects, and unfortunately fit
the definition of MPDG. However audiences loathe
these characters because they look out for themselves in
the end rather than serving the good hair struggling male
lead.

Take Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and
I hate to be that guy but as much as I adore the movie I’m
fonder of the book. My main reasoning is because is the book
she flees never to return in order to serve her own interest,
but the movie they have this shitty ending where her and cat embrace Fred and they all find themselves in each other. But
in the real conclusion, Holly is romanized a ridiculous amount, and firstly seen as selfish for putting her needs in front of his.
60’s audiences wouldn’t accept this original character, I get it, this was a controversial role as it was. Every basic girls muse, Marilyn Monroe turned it down because she didn’t want to be seen as a floosy. And although it was made for a simple minded audiences, young girls still aspire to playing the moon river on the guitar for a
googgly eyed confused 20-something. My heart also holds dearly Daisy Buchanan, firstly because growing up there were no lead beauties who had the privilege of sharing my name, and secondly because I truly believe she gets
a bad wrap. She is a self-proclaimed ‘beautiful little fool’, she advertises this early on and uses it as her excuse for pursuing her means. It may be abandoning one man for another, one who adores her for one who tolerates her, we must remember this was the 20’s, she lived to be a wife. The
obsession Gatsby developed with Daisy was pos- sessive, senseless and held her to crazy high
standards. Just imagine, waking up next to a man everyday who had admired you
from afar for years, built their fortune around you, altered their life around
you, bought real estate for you. Once a guy bought me dinner and to this day I feel in debt to him. She now has pressure to be the picture of
perfection that he has arranged in his distorted pretty head, setting the
poor thing up for failure. You can all hate sweet Daisy, but step back
and see the lack of romance in this and existence of possession. Last but not least is 500 Days
Of Summer title character, Summer. I have a soft spot
for Summer but the lazy writing makes me despise her. Throwaway comments like “50% marriages end in
divorce... like my parents.” Wow how deep of you and not
completely two-dimensional.
Summer is the clear villain in this movie and we are positioned to hate
her for finding happiness. A stand out scene in this movie is when Tom reflects on mo-
ments he saw as golden and sees them not so bright. He has romanticized every element of their relations
and distorted his perception of her. Tom’s biggest strength is that he is played by the ever so adorable
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, so it is slightly impossible to hate him but even he has admitted to hating his character.
I never really wanted to be this cool girl, and I must remind myself this in my moments of weakness. Doesn’t matter if I’m wearing thongs or doc martins, listening to The
Smiths or Taylor Swift or driving my mum’s car or a unicycle decorated with flowers, I am not a tool for your advancement. My choices aren’t put out there for a boy who can barely grow a
moustache to pawn and fuss over. Please never describe anything I do as quirky or tell your friends “you’re really into an alternative
gal”. I won’t be mysterious for you, I’ll overanalyze and ask to watch Clueless and crush any element of cool you construct. Now let me
dance in a pansy field in peace please
